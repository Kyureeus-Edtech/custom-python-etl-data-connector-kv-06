# Software Architecture Assignment: Custom Python ETL Data Connector

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in Python that:

1. **Extracts** data from a given API endpoint.
2. **Transforms** the data into a structured format.
3. **Loads** the transformed data into a MongoDB collection.

The script uses environment variables stored in a `.env` file for secure handling of API and database credentials.

## API Endpoint details

### Endpoint Used :

https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json

- This API provides detailed information about known vulnerabilities, including CVE IDs, vendor details, affected products, descriptions, associated CWEs, and remediation actions.
- The API returns vulnerability information in JSON format.
- This endpoint does not require authentication.

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "cveID": "CVE-2025-20337",
  "vendorProject": "Cisco",
  "product": "Identity Services Engine",
  "vulnerabilityName": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Injection Vulnerability",
  "dateAdded": "2025-07-28",
  "shortDescription": "Cisco Identity Services Engine contains an injection vulnerability in …",
  "dueDate": "2025-08-18",
  "knownRansomwareCampaignUse": "Unknown",
  "requiredAction": "Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01…",
  "notes": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityA…",
  "cwes": ["CWE-74"]
}
```
